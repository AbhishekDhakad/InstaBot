#  InstaPy

Instapy is an Instagram automated bot that has additional interesting and useful features.

## 🎯 About
I have started this project to learn how to structure a good-looking GUI in python and also to learn how to automate websites to do repetitive stuff on their own.\
With the use of this bot, you can download profile pictures, save bios in a text file of many users, view users, and save their info in a text file as well.\
It has the feature of sending messages, view followers, followings & unfollowers (those who didn't follow you back).\
For now, this project is only working in Windows, I'll try to make it work in Linux as well, as soon as possible.\
Go try it and please let me know if you enjoyed it with a ⭐️, I would appreciate it a lot.

## ✨ Features
✔️ Dp - Download profile pictures of multiple users.\
✔️ Bio - Save bio in a text file of multiple users.\
✔️ View Info - Save basic info like the number of followers, following, posts, etc in a text file.\
✔️ Message - Send the same message to multiple users.\
✔️ Bomber - Send the same message to one user multiple times.\
✔️ Follow - Follow multiple users(can use already saved text file).\
✔️ Unfollow - Unfollow multiple users(can use already saved text file).\
✔️ Follower/Unfollower - Get a list of your followers, followings, or unfollowers.
